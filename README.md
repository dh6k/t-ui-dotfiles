# t-ui-dotfiles
My personal dotfiles for t-ui launcher in android.
You can freely use this dotfiles as you want.
Default font is Cascadia Code.
Install it by downloading the code (press green code button then *Download ZIP*), extract the ZIP files, copy the *t-ui* folder into */storage/emulated/0/* then back to the launcher and simply type *restart* then press enter
You may have to force close the launcher to apply this dotfiles.
